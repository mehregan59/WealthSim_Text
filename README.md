# WealthSim — Build Your Future

A behavioral investment simulation disguised as a city-building game.

## What it is

WealthSim is not an investment game. It is a behavioral simulation. Players build a city that quietly represents their financial future. Every decision measures a real behavioral investment trait. Only after finishing does the game reveal what each decision represented in the real world.

## Languages

English and German (toggle in top-right corner).

## How to play
